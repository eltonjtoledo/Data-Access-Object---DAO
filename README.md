# Data Access Object - DAO

This class model was created while I was studying PDO with PHP7.

## Get Started

The main class is SQL, which extends from the PDO and connects to the database in the construction method.

To begin, change the settings of database in the connection string in the sql class.

The User class was created to manage create, update, read and delete in the user table and login.
